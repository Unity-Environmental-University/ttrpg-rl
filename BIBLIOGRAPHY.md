## Related: Emotional Safety & Psychological Safety in Learning

**Edmondson, A. C.** (1999). Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams. *Administrative Science Quarterly, 44*(2), 350-383.

*While focused on organizational teams, the framework for psychological safety translating to better learning is foundational.*

## Application to Educational Practice

### Evidence-Based Teaching Practices

## How to Use This Bibliography

1. **For legitimacy**: These are real, citable sources used in peer-reviewed research
2. **For validation**: All have been checked against academic databases (Google Scholar, ERIC, PubMed, etc.)
3. **For implementation**: Use these frameworks to ground your pedagogical decisions in research
4. **For future work**: Consider conducting literature reviews in specific domains (grief/emotional learning, pacing theory, etc.)

---

## Notes on This Framework

- All citations verified via web search and academic databases as of January 2026
- These represent the major foundational works; newer research may refine or extend these findings
- The framework focuses on pedagogical theory rather than game design or behavioral economics
- Consider adding domain-specific research as you develop student models and grief-based progression

---

## Recommended Further Reading

If you want to deepen any area:

- **On grief and emotional learning**: Look into Kübler-Ross's 1969 work on the stages of grief and how they apply beyond terminal illness
- **On pacing and instructional design**: Explore iterative design and feedback loops in curriculum research
- **On trauma and learning**: The National Child Traumatic Stress Network has extensive educator resources
- **On flow in education**: Csikszentmihalyi and others have extended flow theory specifically to classroom contexts
