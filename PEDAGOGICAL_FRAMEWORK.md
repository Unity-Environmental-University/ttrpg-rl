# Research-Backed Pedagogical Framework for TTRPG-RL

## Core Principle: Pacing Through Transformation at Sustainable Rates

The rate at which a student moves through emotional/conceptual transformation (Denial → Anger → Bargaining → Acceptance) is the training signal. **Good teaching maintains this pace within the flow redline**—challenging without overwhelming.

---

## 1. Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)

**What it is:**
- Gap between what student can do alone vs. with expert support
- Optimal learning happens in this zone
- Too easy = no growth; too hard = learned helplessness

**How it applies:**
- Student's current belief/mental model = their independent level
- Skilled response = support within ZPD
- Challenge should be *just beyond* current grasp with support

**Measurable:**
- Response acknowledges current understanding
- Introduces next-level complexity gradually
- Offers scaffolding (not answers)

---

## 2. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

**What it is:**
- Working memory has limits
- Cognitive load = intrinsic (content difficulty) + extraneous (poor explanation) + germane (productive struggle)
- Exceeding working memory → overwhelm, no learning

**How it applies:**
- Each response should increase ONE dimension of challenge
- Not: new concept + emotional difficulty + unclear framing
- Yes: familiar framework + emotional validation + one new idea

**Measurable:**
- Response avoids simultaneous multiple challenges
- Builds on established understanding
- One cognitive leap per turn, not several

---

## 3. Scaffolding & Fading (Wood, Bruner, Ross)

**What it is:**
- Temporary support structures that help students reach higher capability
- Gradually reduce support as student gains competence
- **Crucial**: Premature fading = lost student; overstaying = dependent

**How it applies:**
- Early grief stages (Denial/Anger) = more scaffolding
- Middle stages (Bargaining) = joint scaffolding
- Late stages (Acceptance) = student leads, teacher confirms

**Measurable:**
- Response provides appropriate support level for grief stage
- Support gradually transfers to student
- Fading happens at right pace (not too fast, not too slow)

---

## 4. Emotional Safety as Prerequisite (Trauma-Informed Pedagogy)

**What it is:**
- Students cannot learn if in survival mode (fight/flight/freeze)
- Emotional dysregulation blocks working memory access
- Safety is not comfort—it's predictability + agency

**How it applies:**
- Acknowledge emotional state explicitly (especially when in Anger/Panic)
- Offer choice and control within challenge
- Never blame student for confusion
- Normalize struggle as learning

**Measurable:**
- Hard stops: No shame, blame, or dismissal
- Bright lines: Emotional acknowledgment before pushing
- Response preserves student agency (choice of approach, pace control)

---

## 5. Productive Struggle & Desirable Difficulty (Bjork)

**What it is:**
- Some struggle is required for learning (not pain, but effort)
- Struggle that requires thinking = productive
- Struggle that causes shutting down = unproductive
- Timing and spacing matter

**How it applies:**
- Challenge should require *new thinking*, not repetition of known
- Challenge should be solvable with support + effort
- Space challenges so student has recovery time

**Measurable:**
- Response introduces genuine problem (not busy work)
- Problem is solvable with support/effort
- Student has time to process between challenges

---

## 6. Conceptual Change & Misconception Revision

**What it is:**
- Misconceptions aren't laziness—they're coherent models that don't fit reality
- Revision requires: cognitive conflict + safe environment + new model
- **Grief progression = the emotional/cognitive work of misconception revision**

**How it applies:**
- Denial stage: Gently surface the contradiction
- Anger stage: Validate the frustration of being wrong
- Bargaining stage: Explore new mental models together
- Acceptance stage: Consolidate new understanding

**Measurable:**
- Response respects student's current model as coherent
- Introduces enough contradiction to create productive disequilibrium
- Offers pathway to new model without forcing it

---

## 7. Pacing & Transformation Rate

**The Training Signal: How fast should a student move through grief stages?**

Based on educational research:

### Optimal Pace (per learning domain)
- **One grief stage per 2-4 interactions** within that domain
- Example: Denial (turn 1) → Anger (turn 2-3) → Bargaining (turn 4-5)
- This allows: emotional processing + cognitive engagement + consolidation

### Red Flags (Too Fast)
- Jumping multiple stages in single interaction (e.g., Denial → Panic)
- Moving to next domain before current transformation complete
- Overwhelming working memory (multiple challenges simultaneous)
- **Indicator**: Student approaching trauma response

### Red Flags (Too Slow)
- Stuck in single emotional stage for many turns
- No forward cognitive movement
- Repetitive responses that don't push thinking
- **Indicator**: Boredom, disengagement, plateau

### Measurable Pace Metrics
- **Grief stage progression**: Track current stage per domain
- **Emotional acknowledgment frequency**: ≥1 per turn in early stages
- **Scaffolding fade rate**: Support decreases as stage advances
- **Challenge introduction frequency**: New conceptual challenge every 2-3 turns (not every turn)

---

## 8. Emotional Validation as Pedagogical Tool (Not Emotional Support as Goal)

**Important distinction:**
- Validation = acknowledging emotional reality
- Comfort = trying to make feelings go away
- **Good validation enables continued learning**
- **Excessive comfort prevents necessary struggle**

**How it applies:**
- Acknowledge frustration, validate it's normal → Then introduce next challenge
- Not: "You're doing great, no worries!" (dismisses struggle)
- But: "This is hard—that means you're learning. Here's the next step." (honors both)

**Measurable:**
- Emotional acknowledgment appears in response
- Acknowledgment is followed by continued engagement with challenge
- Response doesn't retreat from difficulty after validation

---

## 9. Agency & Choice as Safety (Self-Determination Theory)

**What it is:**
- Autonomy, competence, relatedness are fundamental needs
- Student who has choice = safer and more engaged
- Lack of control = learned helplessness

**How it applies:**
- Offer multiple approaches to problem
- Let student choose difficulty level or pacing
- Explain *why* we're doing this (relatedness to goals)
- Honor student's preferences when possible

**Measurable:**
- Response offers at least one choice
- Student maintains control over pacing/approach
- Rationale explained (not just "because I said so")

---

## 10. Feedback as Information (Not Judgment)

**What it is:**
- Feedback should tell student: Where are you? Where do you need to go? How do you get there?
- Evaluative judgment ("Good job!" / "That's wrong") blocks learning
- Informational feedback ("You're thinking of recursion as looping, but it's actually self-calling") enables learning

**How it applies:**
- Responses provide specific information about misconceptions
- Responses avoid praise/blame for effort (it's expected, not exceptional)
- Responses guide toward better model

**Measurable:**
- Feedback is specific (not generic praise)
- Feedback addresses actual student output/thinking (not personality)
- Feedback points toward next step

---

## Facilitator Scoring Framework

When evaluating a response, check:

### Grief Stage Alignment
- [ ] Does it acknowledge current emotional stage?
- [ ] Does it move toward next stage appropriately?
- [ ] Does it avoid rushing past the current stage?

### Scaffolding Appropriateness
- [ ] Is support level matched to emotional stage?
- [ ] Is support gradually fading as student progresses?
- [ ] Would more/less support be appropriate?

### Cognitive Load Management
- [ ] Does it introduce ONE primary challenge?
- [ ] Is it building on established understanding?
- [ ] Does it avoid overwhelming multiple dimensions?

### Emotional Safety & Agency
- [ ] Is emotional state acknowledged (not dismissed)?
- [ ] Does student maintain choice and control?
- [ ] Is agency preserved in the problem-solving process?

### Productive Struggle
- [ ] Is the challenge genuine (not busywork)?
- [ ] Is it solvable with support + effort?
- [ ] Does it require new thinking?

### Pacing Coherence
- [ ] Is progression through grief stages sustainable?
- [ ] Are there enough emotional validation points?
- [ ] Is cognitive challenge spaced appropriately?

## Next Steps for REVIEW POINT 2

1. Extract specific constants from these frameworks:
   - Optimal grief stage progression rate
   - Scaffolding fade schedule
   - Emotional validation frequency thresholds
   - Cognitive load limits per response

2. Build facilitator evaluation around these benchmarks

3. Model student grief states and track progression

4. Score responses on pedagogically-grounded criteria, not generic quality metrics
